# clojure-oidc-example

This is a sample application that demonstrates how to perform a very basic
[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) flow using Clojure.

This sample contains configuration for two authorization servers: [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and Google. You can change between then by altering the configuration on line 18 of `auth.clj`:

```clj
; Change this between :auth0 and :google to try out the different providers
(def config (:google configs))
```

Details for the authorization servers are already provided, but try altering them to use your own, or even try to add another OIDC-supported authorization server!

## Usage

Run the app using Leiningen:

```sh
lein run 9000
```
